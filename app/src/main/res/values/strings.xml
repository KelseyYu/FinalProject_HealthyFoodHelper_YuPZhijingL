    <string name="app_introduction">This app can help users get a better life. Inside the app, there will be two sections, one is for users to record their diet and exercise, the other one is for users to look up for information about food nutrition. We believe that many people cannot live on a very regular and healthy basis because they cannot realize that their own routines are unhealthy and they lack perseverance. With our app, people can record their own actions and can clearly see their own bit by bit progress. We believe this will promote people\'s self-management.</string>
